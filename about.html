                <p>My name is Natalie Guerrero. I am an intuitive faith healer. Growing up I was a very shy, nervous person. I would always isolate myself and I was very quiet. For the longest time, I was suffering from severe sadness that at one point I started to experience panic attacks and anxiety.</p>
                <p>I always felt a deep connection to my ancestors, my Guardian angel, Archangels, angels and God all my life. However, as I got older, I started to drift apart. It wasn't until 2020-2023 when everything started to feel very heavy.</p>
                <div class="quote">"I remember crying out to God almost down on my knees asking for guidance or to just feel at peace."</div>
                <p>I searched for natural ways to heal. I discovered tarot, reiki, and mediumship, but every time I finished a class, I would feel empty. In May 2023, feeling hopeless, I searched for spiritual healings near me. I found a place that was different. When I arrived, the sadness I always felt was gone. I felt free, relieved, and lighter.</p>
                <p>This inspired me to start my healing journey. My faith has been restored, and I realized this was a calling to be an instrument of God to help those in need.</p>
